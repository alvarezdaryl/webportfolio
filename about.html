								<p>Daryl Alvarez, or simply goes by his nickname <b>Da</b>, is a 20 year-old college student who loves reading classic books, western fashion, and into with photography, and have a thing traveling to metropolis. Since Da was born in Makati City, although was moved in Dasmariñas Cavite when he's 2 years old, they still gone to Makati up until on his 5th grade. Today, he's on his 4th year college taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Cavite State University-Silang Campus.</p>
        						<p>Daryl love listening music, he's a certified musicophile. He likes from the 20th century music to what we call popular music today which genres are Country, Electronic, British folk(thanks to Ed Sheeran), Hip-hop/Rap, Soul, Variety of Pop, but since Daryl is a 90's baby his favorite of all time is R&B since he's also a 2000's kid where Contemporary R&B was the trend up until it's influence to the present music.</p>
        						<p>He also likes dogs, and gets very emotional when he sees dogs being abused, struggled, or died. He dream to have his own Non-Government Organization that took custody of or adopt abused, sick, struggling dogs that people don't want them anymore.</p>
				       			<p>Daryl loves to drink alcohol. He's a hard-drinker as some of his friends say about him. Every time they're hanging out, drinking alcohol is on the top list that they must do during hanging out. He's also a show-off person, he want to let know the public of what/where he's doing right now, he either post  it on facebook tweeting on twitter or on instagram, he's basically an attention seeker.</p>
				       			<p>Daryl is an outgoing person, who can easily make friends in a few minutes, although he has few characterstics of being introvert(which obviously everything has in, vice-versa) he loves hanging out with friends, going to club, or on a nearby bar. He's also has the attitude of what he think is what he'll say right away, but sometimes thinking first before saying anything, but most of the time, he'll say it anyway. He's nice, very nice with everyone, but if someone would done things to him intentionally bad, he'll be your worst... like all of us would be. But then, he's a very forgiving person. What you've done wrong to him? He'll forgive you, give him quite time to just "don't care anymore". And speaking, he likes saying "I DON'T CARE" because he doesn't care at all. But sometimes he do gives a sh*t.</p>
  						      	<p>Since he's an extrovert type of person, any person would actually want to be friend with him, why? [FACT: He doesn't forget freindship, or even just acquaintances, whenever you need someone to talk to, he'll be there, he loves giving advises for people who struggles to something, he loves helping to ease emotional pain to someone.] and since he loves giving advises to his friends and to others also, he likes creating his own quotes for people who struggles in friends, life, money, family etc.. a part-time Philosophos indeed.</p>
